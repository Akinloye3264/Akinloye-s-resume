    <h1 class="summary">About Me</h1>
    <p class="paragraph">My name is Akinloye  Emmanuel Oluwajomiloju, but I’m more than just a name—I’m a passionate builder of dreams grounded in purpose. I’m on a mission to empower Africa through responsible and innovative technology, a journey that began with a deep frustration: watching potential waste away due to lack of access, opportunity, and inclusion. That’s why I’ve chosen to be more than a consumer of technology—I’m becoming a creator, a problem-solver, and a catalyst for change.

Currently, I’m a student at the African Leadership University (ALU), developing my skills to become a software engineer. My learning path is hands-on and purpose-driven. I’ve worked on meaningful projects like a Plagiarism Detector in Python, an e-commerce initiative called ShopNest designed to support small enterprises and create jobs, and I'm also venturing into front-end development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—always exploring new technologies that solve real African problems.

My interests go far beyond code. I’m passionate about urbanization, job creation and education because I believe that Africa’s future will be written not just in lines of code, but in the dignity and empowerment of her people. I blend tech with values, always asking: how can we build solutions that are sustainable, ethical, and inclusive?

In some years to come, I see myself at the helm of platforms and products that connect communities, unlock opportunities, and reflect the richness and resilience of the continent I call home. Every step I take now—from fixing bugs in Code to writing scripts that works—is a step toward that bigger dream.

I’m not just learning to code. I’m learning to lead, to serve, and to build a future worth living in.
